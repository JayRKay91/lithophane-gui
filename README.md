# Lithophane Generator (GUI Version)

A simple desktop application for generating 3D printable lithophanes from images using a clean and user-friendly GUI.

This project is built with Python and Tkinter, aiming to make lithophane generation accessible without the need for a browser or command line.

📸 What Is a Lithophane?
A lithophane is a 3D-printed photo created by varying the thickness of a surface so that light passes through to form an image — commonly used in lamps, window hangers, and night lights.
